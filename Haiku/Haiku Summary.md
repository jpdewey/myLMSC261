# Haiku Project Summary

I created an .aiff file from the Terminal program built within Mac OS of a simple haiku that I found on google. I utilized the "say" command in terminal to read out this haiku and the -o command to create an .aiff file.
I faced very few challenges in this project, only having an issue with occasional typos, or forgetting to include a part of the command that is required for the code to read out correctly.
