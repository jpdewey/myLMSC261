Attempts: Utilized a code that created tons of tabs based on number (see screenshots)
Utilized a code that created a bunch of different groups based on the number (see screenshots)
Utilized a code that created a bunch of lines of groups based on the number (see screenshots)

See more code examples and elaborate
