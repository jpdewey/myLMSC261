# Pyramid Markdown File

## Trial and Error
### Many attempts were made to create this code, the results are listed and shown below:
- Tried a code that created tons of tabs based on number, with just a square of the #'s
- Tried a code that created a bunch of different groups based on the number, with the #'s just in squares
- Tried a code that created a bunch of lines of groups based on the number, staggering them at different placements, and utilized tabs instead of spacing, creating a very spread out pyramid.
- Tried a code that utilized nestled loops to create the spread out pyramid followed by lines of the number '5,' since a number was used in the looping lines instead of a variable.
Then, after these atrocities, I started to actually think about the code more seriously, and ended up with a loop of multiple pyramids. I was able to successfully create the pyramid, but it would repeat many times (seemingly) random.

Following this, it was easy to determine that the issue was too many loops, so I eliminated one of my nestled loops, allowing the pyramid to only print correctly once. I then tested the code with multiple different number values to represent the 'stack,' ultimately determining that my code was sound. I then tested the code in bash, and everything worked out perfectly.

Does this assignment require nestled loops? I am curious to see other solutions that utilize a different path than mine, as I struggled to come up with the most efficient solution, I'm sure there are many.

### Additional troubleshooting
- Throughout the code writing process, I was constantly troubleshooting syntax errors due to typos. A frequent syntax error was typing \m instead of \n, as well as adding incorrect colons where colons were unnecessary.
- The most frustrating issue was when I would copy the long code that I had already written and there would be a space or two at the front of the code, rendering an "unexpected indentation" syntax error.

## Overview
- Throughout this homework assignment (which was the most difficult so far for me), I met challenges and issues that needed to be fixed in order to find the solution. I solved many of these issues using trial and error, as well as going back in my notes to find examples of code that did similar things.
- Had I been given more time (or managed my time more efficiently in the week leading up to midterms), I would've explored more solution options. I have theories about maybe using a counter, and I would love to try to get the nestled loop function to work in my favor. I ended up using only one loop to accomplish the solution, which is really just a if/else code nestled under a loop. I'm unsure as to whether my code is actually considered a loop - these are questions I would love to explore further.
- I did not use any code from others, or collaborate with anyone regarding the code. If my roommate Thomas Michaels was not playing a show, I would've consulted him and throughly documented the dialog to that conversation, since I'm sure his insight would be valuable.
