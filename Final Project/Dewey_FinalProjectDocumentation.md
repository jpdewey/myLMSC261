# Final Project Documentation

## Some Sources
- [How To Build A Website by W3](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_website.asp)

## Process
### Steps
- First, I established an html file called index.html, and began to create an outline of my html code
  - This involved beginning with the standard
  ``` <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, intial-scale=1">
  ```
  - This final line of code was from the "How To Build A Website by W3" source from [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_website.asp), in order to allow the website to translate to multiple devices and still look good
- Next I began to establish my basic body of the site, in order to have a website that can be hosted, before the it looks good through a css file. This process is being done prior to establishing and linking a css file since my goal from Rachael is to have an ugly site that can be hosted by Monday, November 29th, then to make that site pretty.
  - I linked the css file that I plan on using, but didn't call to the css file at all during the basic construction of the website
- I then tested how the site was working and looked by opening the .html file on my computer in my browser, to great success!
    The basic code:
    ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <header>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>JP Dewey</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, intial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
    </header>
    <div>
      <body>
        <h1>
          JP Dewey Music
        </h1>
        <h3>

      <div>
        <h2>Music</h2>
          <br>
          This is where some 30 second demos of music will go (these cuts in my music still need to occur)
          <br>
      <div>
        <h2>Performance</h2>
          <br>
          This is where some embedded videos of performance will go
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
        <h2>Resumé</h2>
          <br>
          This is where both a well-laid out visual representation of my resumé will go, as well as a link to a .pdf of my resumé
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
        <h2>Contact</h2>
          <br>
          JP Dewey can be reached at the following sources:
          <ul>

          <br>

      </div>
        <br>

    </p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    This looked boring, but without any glitches or issues
- The next step is to add some more content, and then begin the process and investigation of hosting the website
