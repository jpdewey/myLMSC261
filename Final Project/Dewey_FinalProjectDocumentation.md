# Final Project Documentation

## Some Sources
- [How To Build A Website by W3](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_website.asp)

## Process
### Steps
- First, I established an html file called index.html, and began to create an outline of my html code
  - This involved beginning with the standard
  ``` <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, intial-scale=1">
  ```
  - This final line of code was from the "How To Build A Website by W3" source from [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_website.asp), in order to allow the website to translate to multiple devices and still look good
- Next I began to establish my basic body of the site, in order to have a website that can be hosted, before the it looks good through a css file. This process is being done prior to establishing and linking a css file since my goal from Rachael is to have an ugly site that can be hosted by Monday, November 29th, then to make that site pretty.
