# Final Project proposal
#### JP Dewey

## 1.	Deliverable
This project will be a professional-level website that showcases myself as a musician in all facets of the music industry that I am versed in. This includes displaying videos of performance, links to soundcloud for playing music I’ve mixed or produced (without sending the user to the soundcloud website), displaying headshots, my logo, and a potential demo reel. The website will be divided into sections, including a Home page that gives an overview of myself, a Bio/About page with a short biography, a Music page that displays some of the work I’ve done, and a Contact page that gives the resources for getting in touch with me.
## 2.	Problem
This project solves the problem of not being able to easily communicate and display works that I have done. This would serve as a virtual resumé, easily accessible for employers and potential clients to see and listen to an overview of my music. Currently, I have no easy way of giving examples of my music.
## 3.	Resources
Musician Websites I like (more to come):
[Joe Carrier](http://www.joecarrier.net/)
[Thomas Michaels](http://www.thomasjmichaels.com/index.html)
Code:
Code sharing from Thomas Michaels (my roommate and owner of the second site above)
[This website has a useful beginner’s guide](https://websitesetup.org/website-coding-html-css/)
[This is another website that has a useful beginner’s guide](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_website.asp)
[This is a source of HTML templates (similar to python modules?)](https://html.com/resources/free-html-templates/)
## 4.	Use Cases
My audience will be potential employers and clients in order to provide a resource to market myself and share my music.
## 5.	Timeline
a.	Week 9: Project proposal
b.	Week 10: Gather further resources and code based on meeting with Rachel, download required software, research hosting a website
c.	Week 11: Outline basic website structure in code (different pages, headings, font, backgrounds, etc.)
d.	Week 12: Begin inserting text information into different web pages (bio, contact information, etc.), clean up aesthetics/color schemes
e.	Week 13: Begin inserting videos and audio links for easy displays of musicality, insert a direct messaging contact feature that links to professional email address
f.	Week 14: Clean up all aesthetics, troubleshoot any issues from previous weeks that may still be present, finish up any remaining work
g.	Week 15: Turn in final product
## 6.	Assessment
I think assessment should be based on how well the website works, as well as how clear and professional the website appears. Professionalism and ease of use are key in order to keep users engaged while viewing the website, so these are also important elements to the website. Additionally, the code running correctly and all aspects of the website working efficiently are important aspects that should also be assessed.
