#Mice Documentation

- This week I created a program in python that printed the words "3 Blind Mice" on three different lines with three different tabs
- I struggled with a multitude of problems. Firstly, I made simple syntax mistakes while creating the initial lines of code, such as using "/n" instead of "\n" for a new line. The main issue that I ran into was when I was trying to open the saved python program in terminal, it was unable to run due to "syntax issues". I troubleshooted this problem by comparing my code to an example of a working python code from Rachel after a small dialog, which allowed me to figure out that I needed to create a new python file using just the bare minimum print function in order for the python code to run in the CLI, Terminal.
  - I also troubleshooted this problem by listening to all of my classmates complain and troubleshoot out loud, which allowed me to quickly determine the solution by learning from their mistakes. They were unaware collaborators.
