# Band Site Assignment Summary
## JP Dewey

### Site:

### Problems and Decisions:
- The first decision that was made was that we would be a micro-tonal jazz group known as "The Berkle√© Boys." We then decided that we would divide the tasks into sections, starting with the bios. In theory, this would have made coding much more efficient, as we could merge our own sections and then edit the whole file once all of the bios were in their respecitve places.
- One issue that arose right from the start was merging branches. We were unsure of how to properly format the code and establish a proper outline in order to reduce clashing. We lost a half hour of time since the outline did not properly allow our code to be merged together, so the website was unable to be efficiently made. This was a grevious error on our part, and not reconciling this fast enough cost us a lot of time.
- Due to this significant loss of time, the bulk of the extra things (such as the css, image, audio, etc.) fell on individuals merging on to the main, since this was a process we were all familiar with.

### Individual Contribution
I felt that I contributed quite a bit to the group, taking some level of a leadership role when it came to troubleshooting and dividing up the tasks. I also assisted Sungha rather personally, coaching him through branches via github desktop, since he lacked confidence and ability with this process.

### Team Contributions
Dom: Dom was solid, he did an excellent job with everything regarding the coding. He was instrumental in the fluidity of the project.
Claire: Claire was also solid, she did an excellent job with everything and also did her share of the work. Between Claire, Dom, and I, we each contributed a meaningful portion of code to the website.
Sungha: Sungha was definitely the weakest in the group, requiring the most amount of assistance, which was provided by the rest of the group. His only contribution was his bio, with the main weakness being navigating github, the code he wrote worked perfectly.

## Conclusion
Overall, I feel that if we had some more time to work on the project, and were more familiar with branches in github (we all struggled, resulting in a catastrophic loss of time), our website would look and work even better than it already does, including more of the creative things we initially brainstormed when becoming a team.
