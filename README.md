## Notes
- Lots of steps required to compute something, since computers cannot interpret things the same way we do
- Lots of hardware development translated directly into software development over time, as technology improved and software became more commercially viable for companies
- Software exists everywhere, controlling everything in the computer world, and this is all programmed by programmers/coders
