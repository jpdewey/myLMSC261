## Notes
### Section 2.0 to 2.3:
- Lots of steps required to compute something, since computers cannot interpret things the same way we do
- Lots of hardware development translated directly into software development over time, as technology improved and software became more commercially viable for companies
- Software exists everywhere, controlling everything in the computer world, and this is all programmed by programmers/coders

- Simple language *K* which is famous for its "brevity"
- Code is also found in Excel, hidden behind numbers (which sometimes causes problems)
- Scratch: a programming language for kids
- Code is essentially lines of a language to speak to computers, which results in actions performed by the computer
- Compilers transform code into instructions
- Computers "understand" by going _bit by bit_, transforming the code as they go
- __Every character matters__
- Very repetitive, strings are often repeated over and over again

### Section 2.4: Algorithms
- Algorithms referred to in pop culture are inaccurate, those are describing software (Facebook's algorithm, etc.)
- Algorithms solve problems, with famous ones getting names and Wikipedia pages (like all famous things)
- Many algorithms come built into programs or can be downloaded for free, and run as pure mathematical entities representing practical expressions of ideas
- Computer science is based around efficiency
- Machine learning is based around tons of algorithms breaking down complex tasks into simple tasks for the computer to perform, resulting in a believable response from Siri
- Programming languages need to wrap up lots of algorithms to be reused easily
- Programming shouldn't repeat itself too much, one function can be repeated over and over

### Section 2.5 to 2.6:
- Conferences are large in programming culture
- Sexual harassment/assault/misogyny is too prevalent in coding world
- More women need to be in technology, less than a fifth of undergrad degrees in computer science go to women
- Large tech companies are only about _30%_ female!
